Ever Be - Bethel

Verse 1
Your Love Is Devoted Like A Ring Of Solid Gold
Like A Vow That Is Tested Like A Covenant Of Old

Your Love Is Enduring Through The Winter Rain
And Beyond The Horizon With Mercy For Today

Pre-Chorus
Faithful You Have Been And Faithful You Will Be
You Pledge Yourself To Me And It’s Why I Sing

Chorus
Your Praise Will Ever Be On My Lips, Ever Be On My Lips
Your Praise Will Ever Be On My Lips, Ever Be On My Lips

Verse 2
You Father The Orphan
Your Kindness Makes Us Whole
And You Shoulder Our Weakness
And Your Strength Becomes Our Own

Now You’re Making Me Like You
Clothing Me In White
Bringing Beauty From Ashes
For You Will Have Your Bride

Free Of All Her Guilt And Rid Of All Her Shame
And Known By Her True Name And It’s Why I Sing

Chorus
Your Praise Will Ever Be On My Lips, Ever Be On My Lips
Your Praise Will Ever Be On My Lips, Ever Be On My Lips

Bridge
You Will Be Praised You Will Be Praised
With Angels And Saints We Sing Worthy Are You Lord
You Will Be Praised You Will Be Praised
With Angels And Saints We Sing Worthy Are You Lord

Chorus
And It’s Why I Sing
Your Praise Will Ever Be On My Lips, Ever Be On My Lips
Your Praise Will Ever Be On My Lips, Ever Be On My Lips

Your Praise Will Ever Be On My Lips, Ever Be On My Lips
Your Praise Will Ever Be On My Lips, Ever Be On My Lips
