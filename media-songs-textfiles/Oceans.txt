Verse 1
You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown where feet may fail

Verse 1
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep my faith will stand

Chorus
I will call upon Your Name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Verse 2
Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand will be my guide

Verse 2
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You’ve never failed and You won’t start now

Bridge
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me

Bridge
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Saviour

Chorus
I will call upon Your Name
Keep my eyes above the waves
My soul will rest in Your embrace
I am Yours and You are mine
