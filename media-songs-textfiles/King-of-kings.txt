Verse
In the darkness, we were waiting
Without hope, without light
Till from heaven, You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes

Verse
To fulfil the law and prophets
To a virgin came the word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt
  
Chorus
Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit
Three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings
 
Verse 2
To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
Verse 2
For even in your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake you died 
 
Verse 3
And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
Verse 3
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored

Verse 4
And the church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel, shall not faint
Verse 4
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me
