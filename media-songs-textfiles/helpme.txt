I'm going out again to earn an honest pay
Help me to put up a good fight
To do what is right... to walk in the light

Help me to swim against the tide
To sing a different tune ... let me shine Your light
help me to give the other cheek
to lend a helping hand. ..t o walk the extra mile

help me keep the faith help me learn to wait
help me trust in You You're forever faithful

help me understand that this world is in Your hand

to see in black and white ... and stand on Your side
Help me Lord Jesus to give up all my rights
to die to my self...so that only You I'll serve

Help me, Jesus help me
My world is in Your hands
My God help me
