Let earth receive her King

While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

An overflowing well - no tongue can tell
Joy, unspeakable joy
Rises in my soul, never lets me go

And makes the nations prove

And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love
