His pride and adoration
Treasures woven by His love

Safe within His promise
Of calling and of destiny

From beginning until the end
You are faithful, faithful to the end

A never-ending story
Of love that’s always chasing me

His kindness overwhelming
And hope for me unending
He’s never given up on me

There wasn’t a day that You weren’t by my side
There wasn’t a day that You let me fall
All of my life, Your love has been true
All of my life, I will worship You
