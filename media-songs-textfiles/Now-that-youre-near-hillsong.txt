REFRAIN
Hold me in Your arms
Never let me go
I wanna spend eternity with You

VERSE
I stand before You, Lord
And give You all my praise
Your love is all I need
Jesus, You're all I need

VERSE
My life belongs to You
You gave Your life for me
Your grace is all I need
Jesus, You're all I need

CHORUS
And now that You're near
Everything is different
Everything's so different, Lord

CHORUS
And I know I'm not the same
My life You've changed
And I wanna be with You
I wanna be with You

BRIDGE
And I will sing for You always, yeah
'Cause in Your presence God is where I wanna stay
