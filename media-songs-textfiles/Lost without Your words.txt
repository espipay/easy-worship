Verse
Welcome To OnSong
these things that stand between us
I gladly throw away
'coz for me You are far better
than anything in this world my Lord sweet Jesus
no one can ever take Your place there's no one can compare with Your love with your grace the warmth of Your embrace

Chorus
how could i live without You when i was born for You
every breath i take is a prayer for You
Lord i'm lost with You
I don't mind if I don't have treasures to hold but without You i'm so cold
for the sun won't shine and the rain will because Jesus You're my all
