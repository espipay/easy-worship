Jesus I Need You by Hillsong

Verse 1
Hope be my anthem
Lord when the world has fallen quiet
You stand beside me
Give me a song in the night

Every moment I need You
Hear now this grace bought heart sing out

Shoulder its burdens
You carry it into the light

Hear now this grace bought heart sing out
