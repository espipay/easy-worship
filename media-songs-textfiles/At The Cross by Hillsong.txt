At The Cross By Hillsong

Verse 1
Oh Lord You've searched me
You know my way
Even when I fail You
I know You love me

Verse 2
Your holy presence
Surrounding me
In every season
I know You love me
I know You love me

Chorus
At the cross, I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this

You have overcome the grave
Your glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now?

Verse 3
You go before me
You shield my way
Your hand upholds me
And I know You love me

Chorus
At the cross, I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this

You have overcome the grave
Your glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now?

At the cross, I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this

You have overcome the grave
Your glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now?

Bridge
You tore the veil
You made a way
When You said that it is done

You tore the veil
You made a way
When You said that it is done

Verse 4
And when the earth fades
Falls from my eyes
And You stand before me
I know You love me
I know You love me

Chorus
At the cross, I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this

You have overcome the grave
Your glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now?

At the cross, I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this

You have overcome the grave
Your glory fills the highest place
What can separate me now?

Outro
You tore the veil
You made a way
When You said that it is done

You tore the veil
You made a way
When You said that it is done
