Title
I Call  Your Name 
by: Free Chapel

[Verse 1]
Holy, Lord God Almighty
Ancient of days, giver of faith
Lord, I need You

[Verse 2]
Worthy, Lord, You're deserving
Of all I have, I lay me down
Lord, I need You

[Chorus]
I call Your name, Lord, You reply
You bring Your kingdom, stand by my side

Giver of life, more than I need
Father, You're everything precious to me
There is no one like You, Lord in all the earth

[Chorus]
I call Your name, Lord, You reply
You bring Your kingdom, stand by my side

Giver of life, more than I need
Father, You're everything that is precious to me

There is no one like You, Lord in all the earth

[Post-Chorus]
In all the earth, in all the earth
There's no one like You, no one like You, Lord

[Bridge]
There's no one like You
There's no one like You, Lord
There's no one like You in all the earth
