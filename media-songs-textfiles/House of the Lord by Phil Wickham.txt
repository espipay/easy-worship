House of The Lord by Phil Wickham

Verse 1
We worship the God who was
We worship the God who is
We worship the God who evermore will be

Pre-Chorus
He opened the prison doors
He parted the raging sea
My God, He holds the victory, yeah

Chorus
There's joy in the house of the Lord
There's joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

There's joy in the house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this placе
And we won't be quiet
Wе shout out Your praise (Oh)


Oh, oh-oh
We shout out Your praise (Oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)

Verse 2
We sing to the God who heals
We sing to the God who saves
We sing to the God who always makes a way

Pre-Chorus
'Cause He hung upon that cross
Then He rose up from that grave
My God's still rolling stones away

Chorus
There's joy in the house of the Lord
There's joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

There's joy in the house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this place
And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise

Bridge
We were the beggars
And now we’re royalty
We were the prisoners
And now we're running free

And we are forgiven, accepted
Redeemed by His grace
Let the house of the Lord sing praise

'Cause we were the beggars
And now we're royalty
And we were the prisoners
And now we're running free

We are forgiven, accepted
Redeemed by His grace
Let the house of the Lord sing praise

[Chorus]
There's joy in the house of the Lord 
There's joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won't be quiet 
We shout out Your praise 

There's joy in the house of the Lord 
Our God is surely in this place 
And we won't be quiet
And we shout out Your praise 

There's joy in the house of the Lord
There's joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won't be quiet
And we shout out Your praise 

There's joy in the house of the Lord 
Our God is surely in this place 
And we won't be quiet 
We shout out Your praise

We shout out Your praise (Oh-oh, oh)
There is joy in this house (Oh-oh, oh)
There is joy in this house today (Oh-oh, oh)
We shout out Your praise (Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

Outro
We shout out Your praise (Oh-oh)
