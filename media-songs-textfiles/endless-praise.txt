Verse 1
You are God, and we lift You up
We keep singing, we keep praising
We won't stop, giving all we got
'Cause You're worthy, of all glory

Pre-chorus
Oh, there is no other, You are forever,     Lord over all
There's nobody like You, no one beside You

Chorus
To You, let endless praise resound
Every night and day, and with no delay
Let endless praise resound

Verse 2
Boundless love, light before the sun
Your glory, eternal
Never stops, giving all You got
Creation, keeps singing

Bridge
We lift You up, up, up
We are giving You our love, love, love
For everything You've done, done, done
We give You all the praise
