Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
The King of Glory, the King above all kings

Who shakes the whole earth with Holy thunder
And leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
The King of Glory, the King above all kings

Chorus
This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
That You would bear my cross

You lay down Your life
That I would be set free
Oh, Jesus, I sing for
All that You've done for me

Who brings our chaos back into order
Who makes the orphan a son and daughter
The King of Glory, the King of Glory

Who rules the nations with truth and justice
Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
The King of Glory, the King above all kings

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave

Worthy, worthy, worthy
