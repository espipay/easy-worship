Verse
Walking around these walls
I thought by now they'd fall
But You have never failed me yet
Waiting for change to come
Knowing the battle's won
For You have never failed me yet

Chorus
Your promise still stands
Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness
I'm still in Your hands
This is my confidence
You've never failed  me yet

Bridge
I've seen You move,    
You move the mountains
And I believe    
I'll see You do it again

Bridge 2
You made a way  
where there was no way
And I believe
I'll see You do it again
