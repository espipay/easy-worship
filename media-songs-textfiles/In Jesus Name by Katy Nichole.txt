Verse 1
I speak the name of Jesus over you 
In your hurting, in your sorrow
I will ask my God to move
I speak the name 'cause it's all that I can do
In desperation, I'll seek Heaven
And pray this for you

Chorus
I pray for your healing, that circumstances would change
I pray that the fear inside would flee in Jesus' name
I pray that a breakthrough would happen today
I pray miracles over your life in Jesus' name
In Jesus' name

Verse 2
I speak the name of all authority
Declaring blessings, every promise
He is faithful to keep
I speak the namе no grave could ever hold
Hе is greater, He is stronger
He's the God of possible

Chorus
I pray for your healing, that circumstances would change
I pray that the fear inside would flee in Jesus' name
I pray that a breakthrough would happen today
I pray miracles over your life in Jesus' name
In Jesus' name, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Come believe it, come receive it
Oh, the power of His Spirit is now forever yours
Come believe it, come receive it
In the mighty name of Jesus, all things are possible

[Chorus]
I pray for your healing, that circumstances will change
I pray that the fear inside would flee in Jesus' name
I pray that a breakthrough would happen today
I pray miracles over your life in Jesus' name
I pray for revival, for restoration of faith
I pray that the dead will come to life in Jesus' name
In Jesus' name
