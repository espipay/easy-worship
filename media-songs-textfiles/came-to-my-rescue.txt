Came To My Rescue

Verse 1
Falling on my knees in worship
Giving all I am to seek Your face
Lord, all I am is Yours

Verse 2
My whole life I place in Your hands
God of Mercy humbled I bow down
In Your presence at Your throne

Chorus
I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I wanna be where You are

My whole life I place in Your hands
God of Mercy, humbled I bow down
In Your presence at Your throne

In my life be lifted high
In our world be lifted high
In our love be lifted high
