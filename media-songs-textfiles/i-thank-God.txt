Verse 1
Wandering into the night
Wanting a place to hide
This weary soul
This bag of bones

Verse 2
I tried with all my might
But I just can’t win the fight
I’m slowly drifting a vagabond

Pre-Chorus 1
And just when I ran out of road
I met a man I didn’t know
And he told me
That I was not alone

Chorus 1
You picked me up turned me around
Placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior

Chorus 1
Because He healed my heart, He changed my name
Forever free I’m not the same
I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
I thank God

Verse 3
I cannot deny what I’ve seen
Got no choice but to believe
My doubts are burning
Like ashes in the wind

Verse 4
So so long to my old friends
Burden and bitterness
You can just keep it moving
Nah you ain’t welcome here

Pre-Chorus 2
From now till I walk the streets of gold
I’ll sing of how You saved my soul
This wayward son
Has found his way back home

Chorus 1
You picked me up turned me around
Placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior

Chorus 1
Because He healed my heart, He changed my name
Forever free I’m not the same
I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
I thank God

Bridge 1
Hell lost another one
I am free
I am free
I am free

Bridge 2
Get up get up get up
Get up out of that grave
Get up get up get up
Get up out of that grave
