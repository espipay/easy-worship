Chorus
Christ is my firm foundation
The Rock on which I stand
When everything around me is shaking
I've never been more glad

'Cause He's never let me down
He's faithful through generations
So why would He fail now?

So why would He fail now?

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Rain came and wind blew
But my house was built on You
I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it through

'Cause I'm standing strong on You
Yeah, I'm gonna make it through
'Cause my house is built on You
