There’s nothing worth more, that will ever come close
No thing can compare, You’re our living hope

I’ve tasted and seen, of the sweetest of loves
Where my heart becomes free, and my shame is undone
In Your presence, Lord

Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere

To be overcome by Your presence Lord
