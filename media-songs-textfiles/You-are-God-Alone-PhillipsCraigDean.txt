Verse
You are not a God 
Created by human hands
You are not a God 
Dependent on any mortal man

Verse
You are not a God in need of anything we can give
By Your plan, that's just the way it is

Chorus
You are God alone from before time began
You were on Your throne You are God alone

Chorus
And right now in the good times and bad
You are on Your throne You are God alone


Verse 
You're the only God whose power
None can contend
You're the only God whose name and
Praise will never end

Verse
You're the only God who's worthy
Of ev'rything we can give
You are God
That's just the way it is

Chorus
You are God alone from before time began
You were on Your throne You are God alone

Chorus
And right now in the good times and bad
You are on Your throne You are God alone

Bridge
You're unchangeable You're unshakable
You're unstoppable that's what You are
