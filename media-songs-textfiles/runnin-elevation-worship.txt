Verse
I have tasted I have seen
The realness of Your love for me
It’s written on Your hands and feet
It’s all the evidence I’ll ever need
 
Chorus
Your love is better than life
I can’t even wrap my mind around it
One day here in Your house
Better than a thousand elsewhere

Chorus
Your love, keeps on runnin runnin
Keeps on runnin after me 
Keeps on runnin runnin
Keeps on runnin after me

There’s no one that can take Your place
There’s nothing that can separate
How high, how wide, how deep
The greatest love the world has ever seen

Chorus
Your love is better than life
I can’t even wrap my mind around it
One day here in Your house
Better than a thousand elsewhere

Chorus
Your love, keeps on runnin runnin
Keeps on runnin after me 
Keeps on runnin runnin
Keeps on runnin after me  

Tag
Run run runnin
Run run runnin
Run run runnin 
after me

Every time,
Every time I turn around

Chorus 
I’m caught up in your presence 
I just want to sit here at your feet
I’m caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave

Chorus
I’m not here for blessings, 
Jesus you don’t owe me anything
More than anything that you can do
I just want you
Nothing else
Nothing else 
Nothing else will do
I just want you
