Through you the mute will sing
Through you the dead will rise

Through you all hearts will praise
Through you the darkness flees
Through you my heart screams
I am free
Yes, I am free

I am free to run
(I am free to run)
I am free to dance
(I am free to dance)

Yes I am free
(I am free)

Verse 2
Through you the kingdom comes
Through you the battle's won
Through you I'm not afraid
Through you the price is paid

Verse 2
Through you there's victory
Because of you my heart sings
I am free
Yes, I am free

Who the son sets free-is free indeed

Who the son sets free-is free indeed
