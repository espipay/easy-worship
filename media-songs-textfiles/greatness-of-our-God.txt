Verse 1:
Give me eyes to see
More of who You are
May what I behold,
Still my anxious heart.

Take what I have known
And break it all apart
For You my God, are greater still.

Chorus:
No sky contains,
No doubt restrains,
All You are,
The greatness of our God.

Chorus cont':
I spend my life to know,
And I'm far from close
To all You are,
The greatness of our God.

Verse 2:
Give me grace to see
Beyond this moment here.
To believe that there
Is nothing left to fear.

That You alone are high
above it all.
For You my God, are greater still.

Chorus: 
No sky contains,
No doubt restrains,
All You are,
The greatness of our God.

Chorus (cont'): 
I spend my life to know,
And I'm far from close
To all You are,
The greatness of our God.

Bridge 1:
And there is nothing
That can ever separate us.
There is nothing that can ever
Separate us from Your love.

Bridge1 (cont'):
No life, no death, of this I am
convinced.
You my God, are greater still.

Bridge 2:
And no words can say, or song
convey, 
All You are the greatness
of our God.

Bridge 2 (cont'):
I spend my life to know,
And I'm far from close
To all You are,
The greatness of our God.
