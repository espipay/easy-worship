HAPPY DAY
Verse 1
The greatest day in history, death is beaten
You have rescued me
Sing it out, Jesus is alive

Verse 2
The empty cross, the empty grave
Life eternal, You have won the day
Shout it all, Jesus is alive
He's alive and...

Chorus
Oh happy day, happy day
You washed my sin away
Oh happy day, happy day
I'll never be the same
Forever I am changed

Verse 3
When I stand, in that place
Free at last, meeting face to face
I am Yours, Jesus You are mine

Verse 4
Endless joy and perfect peace
Earthly pain finally will cease
Celebrate, Jesus is alive,

Bridge
And oh what a glorious day
What a glorious way
That You have saved me
And oh what a glorious day,
What a glorious name, Jesus!
