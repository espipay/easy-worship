Intro 
"One Thing Remains"

Verse
Higher than the mountains that I face
And it's stronger than the power of the grave
Constant in the trial and the change
This one thing remains

Chorus
And Your love never fails, it never gives up
It never runs out on me
And Your love never fails, it never gives up
It never runs out on me
And Your love never fails, it never gives up
It never runs out on me

Chorus 2
And on and on and on and on it goes
It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I'll never, ever, have to be afraid
'Cause this one thing remains
This one thing remains

Chorus
And Your love never fails, it never gives up
It never runs out on me
And Your love never fails, it never gives up
It never runs out on me
And Your love never fails, it never gives up
It never runs out on me
Your love, Your love

Bridge
And in death, and in life
I'm confident and covered by
The power of Your great love
My debt is paid
There's nothing that can separate
My heart from Your great love

Chorus
'Cause Your love never fails, it never gives up
It never runs out on me
Your love never fails, it never gives up
It never runs out on me
Your love never fails, it never gives up
It never runs out on me
Your love

Chorus 2
And on and on and on and on it goes
It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I'll never, ever, have to be afraid
'Cause this one thing remains
This one thing, it remains, remains
