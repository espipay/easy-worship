Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord

Verse 1
I’ll praise in the valley
Praise on the mountain
I’ll praise when I’m sure
Praise when I’m doubting

Verse 2
I’ll praise when outnumbered
Praise when surrounded
Cause praise is the waters
My enemies drown in

Pre Chorus
As long as I’m breathing
I’ve got a reason to

Chorus 1
Praise the Lord oh my soul
Praise the Lord oh my soul

Verse 3
I’ll praise when I feel it
I’ll praise when I don’t
I’ll praise cause I know
You’re still in control

Verse 4
My praise is a weapon
It’s more than a sound
My praise is the shout
That brings Jericho down

Pre Chorus
As long as I’m breathing
I’ve got a reason to

Chorus 1
Praise the Lord oh my soul
Praise the Lord oh my soul

Chorus 2
I won’t be quiet
My God is alive
How could I keep it inside
Praise the Lord my soul

Bridge
I’ll praise cause You’re sovereign
Praise cause You reign
Praise cause You rose
And defeated the grave

Bridge
I’ll praise cause You’re faithful
Praise cause You’re true
Praise cause there’s nobody
Greater than You

Chorus 1
Praise the Lord oh my soul
Praise the Lord oh my soul

Chorus 2
I won’t be quiet
My God is alive
How could I keep it inside

Chorus 2
I won’t be quiet
My God is alive
How could I keep it inside
Praise the Lord my soul

Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
