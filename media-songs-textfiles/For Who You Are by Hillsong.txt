Verse 1
Standing here in Your presence
Thinking of the good things You have done
Waiting here patiently
Just to hear Your still small voice again

Pre-Chorus
Holy
righteous
faithful to the end

Saviour
Healer
Redeemer and friend

Chorus
I will worship You for who You are
I will worship You for who You are
I will worship You for who You are
Jesus

Bridge
My soul secure
Your promise sure
Your love endures always
