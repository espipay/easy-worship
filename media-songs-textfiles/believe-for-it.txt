They say these chains will never break
But they don't know You like we do
There is power in Your name

We've heard that there is no way through
We've heard the tide will never change

There is power in Your name
So much power in Your name

Break the unbreakable
God we believe
God we believe for it

From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God we believe
God we believe for it

For there is still an empty grave
God we believe no matter what
There is power in Your name
So much power in Your name

Move the unmovable
Break the unbreakable
God we believe
God we believe for it

From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God we believe
God we believe for it (hey)

You are the way
When there seems to be no way
We trust in You
God You have the final say, yeah

God we believe for it
