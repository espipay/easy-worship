Verse 1
Your light broke through my night
Restored exceeding joy
Your grace fell like the rain
And made this desert live

Chorus
You have turned
My mourning into dancing
You have turned
My sorrow into joy

Verse 2
Your hand lifted me up
I stand on higher ground
Your praise rose in my heart
And made this valley sing

Chorus
You have turned
My mourning into dancing
You have turned
My sorrow into joy


Bridge 1
This is how we overcome
This is how we overcome


Chorus

You've turned
My mourning into dancing
You have turned
My sorrow into joy

Chorus

()You have turned
My mourning into dancing
You have turned
My sorrow into joy
