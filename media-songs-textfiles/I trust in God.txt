Verse 1
Blessed Assurance, Jesus is mine
He's been my fourth man in the fire time after time

Verse 2
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood
And what He did for me on Calvary is more than enough

Chorus
I trust in God, my Savior
The one who will never fail
He will never fail

Verse 2
Perfect submission, all is at rest
I know the author of tomorrow has ordered my steps

Verse 2
So this is my story and this is my song
Praising my risen King and Savior all the day long

Chorus
I trust in God, my Savior
The one who will never fail
He will never fail

Bridge
I sought the Lord and He heard and He answered
I sought the Lord and He heard and He answered
I sought the Lord and He heard and He answered
That's why I trust Him, that's why I trust Him
