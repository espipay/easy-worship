His one and only Son to save us
Whoever believes in Him will live forever

His one and only Son to save us
Whoever believes in Him will live forever

The power of hell forever defeated
Now it is well, I'm walking in freedom
For God so loved, God so loved the world

Praise God, praise God
From whom all blessings flow
Praise Him, praise Him
For the wonders of His love

Bring all your failures, bring your addictions
Come lay them down at the foot of the cross
Jesus is waiting, God so loved the world
