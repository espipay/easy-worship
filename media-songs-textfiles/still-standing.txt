Verse 1
You gave me courage to believe
That all Your goodness I will see

Verse 1
And if it had not been for You
Standing on my side where would I be

Chorus
If not for Your goodness, If not for Your grace
I don't know where I would be today
If not for Your kindness
I never could say, I'm still standing

Chorus
If not for Your mercy, If not for Your love
I most likely would have given up
If not for Your favor, I never could say

Chorus
I'm still standing
But by the grace of God

Verse 2
To You I lift my offering
And set my heart on higher things

Verse 2
For if it had not been
For You standing on my side where would I be

Chorus
If not for Your goodness, If not for Your grace
I don't know where I would be today
If not for Your kindness
I never could say, I'm still standing

Chorus
If not for Your mercy, If not for Your love
I most likely would have given up
If not for Your favor, I never could say

Chorus
I'm still standing
But by the grace of God

Bridge
On Christ the solid rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
On Christ the solid rock I stand
But by the grace of God

Bridge
I'm still standing, 
I'm still standing
I'm still standing 
but by the grace of God
