Verse 1
There's a table that You've prepared for me
In the presence of my enemies

Verse 1.2
It's Your body and Your blood You've shed for me
This is how I fight my battles

Pre-Chorus
And I believe You've overcome
And I will lift my song of praise for what You've done

Chorus
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how

Verse 2.1
In the valley I know that You're with me
And surely Your goodness and mercy follow me

Verse 2.2
So my weapons are praise and thanksgiving
This is how I fight my battles
