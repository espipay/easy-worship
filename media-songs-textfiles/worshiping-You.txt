Verse 1
Take this offering that I bring
Humbly I fall on my knees to proclaim You're everything
My life's nothing without You, take my hand and lead me through
You are my sustaining love

Pre-Chorus
I live to worship You, I live to worship You

Chorus 1
Here I am worshiping You
With all I am, worshiping You
Bowing down in spirit and truth
With lifted hands, worshiping You

Bridge 2
I'm gonna worship You forever, I'm gonna worship You
I'm gonna worship You forever, I'm gonna worship You
