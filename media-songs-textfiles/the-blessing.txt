Bridge 1
May His favor be upon you
And a thousand generations
And your family and your children
And their children, and their children

Bridge 2
May His presence go before you
And behind you, and beside you
All around you, and within you
He is with you, He is with you

Bridge 3
In the morning, in the evening
In your coming, and your going
In your weeping, and rejoicing
He is for you, He is for you
