Verse 1
So here it is, my alabaster heart
I'm keeping nothing back from who You are
No hidden treasure veiled by key or lock
You're a lifetime worth of worship
And that's only just the start

Verse 2
Here it is, my every waking day
The minutes, hours, the years of endless praise
For You're worthy far beyond all I could say
There's a lifetime worth of worship
In the nuance of Your names

Chorus
So let it rise like incense
My whole life a fragrance
Every ounce here broken at Your feet

Chorus
Every breath an offering
My heart cries, these lungs sing
Over You, my worthy King of kings

Verse 
There it is, Your alabaster cross
Giving all You are for all I'm not
I can't believe that's the kind of King You are
How could I not bring a lifetime worth of worship to You, God

Bridge
All my love, all my love, all my love
You can have it all  
All my heart, all my soul, all my own
You can have it all
We're gonna lay it all down
We're gonna bring it all now
