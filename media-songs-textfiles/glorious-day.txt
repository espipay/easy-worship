Verse 1
I was buried beneath my shame
Who could carry that kind of weight
It was my tomb
Till I met You

Verse 2
I was breathing but not alive
All my failures I tried to hide
It was my tomb
Till I met You

Chorus
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day

Verse 3
Now Your mercy has saved my soul
Now Your freedom is all I know
The old made new
Jesus, when I met You

Chorus
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day
You called my name
And I ran out of that grave
Out of the darkness
Into Your glorious day
