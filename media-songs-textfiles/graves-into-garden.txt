Verse 
I searched the world
But it couldn't fill me
Man's empty praise and treasures that fade are never enough

Verse 
Then You came along
And put me back together
And every desire is now satisfied
Here in Your love (Hey)

Chorus
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You

Verse
I'm not afraid
To show You my weakness
My failures and flaws
Lord, You've seem them all
And You still call me friend

Verse
'Cause the God of the mountain
Is the God of the valley
There's not a place Your mercy and grace
Won't find me again

Chorus
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You 

Bridge 1
You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You're the only one who can 

Bridge 2
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can (He's the only Lord)
You're the only one who can
